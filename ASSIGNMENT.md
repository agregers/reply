# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I "learned" to use the reply library by reading the README.md file that the author included in the files,
as well as try to look over the code several times from top to bottom in order to get a gist of which functions and
variables had certain dependencies. I found it difficult to understand the original files because there was a lack of
comments on each function, hence why it is important to have good comments. I didn't find it hard to understand the gist of
the file and it's functions overall though because their package.json file was well laid out and easy to understand as well. 
I thought that most of the functions and variables were well named, but some could have been changed to better describe what the
functions purpose was.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> "Raising the level of abstraction" to me means making a comment so easy to understand that someone not very code literate could understand what
the code following the comment did in general. It should be abstract in the sense of not step-by-step telling the reader what the code does and how it 
does it, but instead giving a brief, overarching picture of what the code in regards to the overall program. 
I would tell a new CSE 142 student to write their comments in the same way they may try to explain their functions or variables to a friend not familiar with
coding, or their program. Make the comments general, but still touch on what the code beneath does. When I say general, I mean don't give nitty gritty details
(implementation details) but instead give helpful comments such as what the code's purpose is, what it needs to run smoothly (necessary parameters), what
the function returns, and/or what type the variable is. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me approximately 8 - 10 hours to go through the prompt, read through / understand the npm module I would be working on (reply) and to finish commenting
and adding details that would be helpful for a user that may be using this module. I then spent another 1 1/2 hours on completing this write up. So overall I would
say I spent 10+ hours on this assignment overall.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I did some research using Node.js documentation online @ https://nodejs.org/api to get a better grasp on what certain modules did (ex. readline)
I also relied heavily on the website @ http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html to understand the formatting for commenting in js. I also
got help from Joel on fixing an octale error that showed up when I tried installing jsdocs.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I wouldn't say that there is a specific problem with the assignment, but having more options under the list of modules that could be used for the assignment
may make the assignment better and allow students more ideas of starting points. I also had a difficult time fixing an octale error, but luckily Joel was available
to show me a solution to get my jsdocs up and running. More explanation of jsdocs in the future would be helpful overall.
